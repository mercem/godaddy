# GoDaddy Code Challenge

To run the project:

Install packages: `npm install`

Start the project: `npm start`

Run test: `npm test`

I added 'react-router' and 'material-ui' packages. Rest are default 'create-react-app' packages ('jest', 'react-testing-library' etc.).

The reason I add 'react-router' is to manage page navigations between home page and detail page.

The reason I add 'material-ui' is to use UI components to have better visualizations.
